You are a video investigator.
User Query: "{{ user_query }}"

Video Title: {{ video_title }}

I have sampled {{ num_frames }} frames from the video at specific timestamps:
{{ frame_descriptions }}

Transcript (with timestamps):
{{ transcript }}

Task:
Identify all specific temporal windows (start_time to end_time) in the video that are relevant to answering the User Query.
- Combine visual cues from the frames and semantic cues from the transcript.
- If the answer is in the transcript, use its timestamps.
- If the answer is visual, use the frame timestamps to estimate the window.
- If the video is irrelevant, return an empty list or set relevant to false.
- Provide a brief reasoning for each selected window. 

Output Format (JSON):
{
    "relevant": true/false,
    "windows": [
        {
            "start_time_seconds": <float>,
            "end_time_seconds": <float>,
            "reasoning": "..."
        },
        ...
    ]
}
